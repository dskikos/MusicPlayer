At my internship, I have been dabbling around with algorithms operating on graphs. Often times, the real challenge is not quite the algorithm itself, but all the prework required for the input data. This input data often comes in the form of excel files. I hate sloppy workflows, so I always try to automate processes as much as possible, from end to end. Because of this, the final state of most pf my projects is the development of a basic GUI. I do not want people to have to look around the code to edit file input paths. I find that idea ridiculous and a sheer waste of time. However, for most GUIs I have made, I have relied extensively on AI chatbots, to the point that I have used TKinter countless times, without really understanding what the elements do.

This project is essentially an exercise in relearning the basics of TKinter. It is not the prettiest, but my skills are not polished enough yet.
